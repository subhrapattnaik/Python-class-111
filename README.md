 Most data in the world can be plotted as a normal distribution which looks like a bell-curve.
- Mean of a population in a normal distribution is at its peak.
- Most of the data (68%) in the population lie within one standard deviation from the mean.
- 95 % of data lie within two standard deviations from the mean and 99% of data lie within three standard deviation from the mean.



- Sampling distribution is the distribution created when we plot means of 1000s of samples with a fixed sampling size.


- Mean of a sampling distribution is the same as the mean of the population.

- Standard deviation of the sampling distribution (also called standard error of the mean) 
= standard deviation of the population distribution / sqrt (sampling size).


if sampling size is 100 ,sqrt(100)=10

so,
- Standard deviation of the sampling distribution (also called standard error of the mean) 
= standard deviation of the population distribution / 10
